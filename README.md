## Introduction:  
<div align="justify">In this repository, we will investigate into stock market data, focusing on stocks such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. We'll use the yfinance library to retrieve stock information and visualize various aspects using Seaborn and Matplotlib. We'll also explore different methods for analyzing stock risk based on historical performance and employ Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict future stock prices.</div><br>

Time Series Data Overview:<div align="justify">Time series data is a sequence of data points collected at regular time intervals to track changes over time. Time series data consists of data points indexed in chronological order.</div> 

## Objectives:  
<div align="justify">This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data and predicting future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The objective is to build and evaluate an LSTM model to forecast stock prices based on historical data, helping to identify trends and make informed investment decisions.</div><br>

We will address the following cases in this notebook:

- Change in stock price over time
- Average daily return of the stock
- Moving averages for the different stocks
- Stocks correlation with each other
- Risk associated with investing in a particular stock
- Prediction of future stock behavior (Using LSTM)

## Analysis Approach:    
<div align="justify">To tackle this problem effectively, I have established a structured data analysis approach.</div> <br>

- Data Collection: Gathering and preprocessing historical stock market data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset
- Visualizations: It includes creating visual representations of the data to facilitate a better understanding of the insights, trends, and relationships
- Model Development: Building and training an LSTM network for stock price forecasting
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics
- Prediction: Generating and analyzing forecasts for future stock prices

## Summary:
<div align="justify">In this notebook, we will investigate and analyze stock data. In particular, we will learn:</div><br>
